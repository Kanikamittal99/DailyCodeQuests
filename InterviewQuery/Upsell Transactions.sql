Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.

Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold, or in other words, the number of users who bought additional products after their first purchase.

Note: If the customer purchased two things on the same day, that does not count as an upsell, as they were purchased within a similar timeframe.

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    created_at DATETIME,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT
);

INSERT INTO orders (id, user_id, created_at, product_id, quantity) VALUES
